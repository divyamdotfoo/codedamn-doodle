# Doodle with nextjs, tRPC and pusher

In this project we will learn how to build a realtime game room in which users can chat and doodle with their friends.

## What is Nextjs?

Tldr : Its the best react full stack framework out there and you will agree with this till the end of this project.
Nextjs is a fullstack react framework which allows you work in serverless environments and provide a very clean file based routing system for all your application routing needs moreover nextjs supports react server components and server actions which makes its more easy for developers to make fullstack application

## What is tRPC?

Ever wondered what development will look like if you get full typesafety for your fetch requests and if you dont need to send all those data in your fetch request with mulitple headers and body. tRPC got your back, with tRPC you will never ever have to use old fetch api like you are used to , you have to just call the function you want and it magically works .
PS: Under the hood tRPC uses REST, but for developers its another layer of good abstraction.

## What is pusher?

Have you ever deployed your express server online?? So you know how much pain it is to scale those and the cost associated with them . Pusher is a realtime service which works best for serverless environments like Nextjs and you dont need to create your own websocket server (like using socket.io)

### Dont worry if you dont get all these

- By the end of this project you will be able to work with tRPC in nextjs
- You will understand how zustand and react-query works and how to use them
- You will know how to make the canvas realtime and build a chat room
- and many more .....

lets get started go to the challenges tab to complete your very first challenge.
